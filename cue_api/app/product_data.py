== Facelift ==
A facelift (LCI) was announced in May 2022 for the seventh generation BMW 3 Series.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 18, 2022 |title=2022 BMW 3 Series facelift debuts - G20 LCI gets new headlamps, grille; widescreen display for interior - paultan.org |url=https://paultan.org/2022/05/18/2022-bmw-3-series-facelift-debuts-g20-lci/}}</ref>

The updated model has new front and rear bumpers, new headlights and a slightly tweaked grille. The headlights have a new "inverted L shape" DRL signature (that is now standard on all models) and the top Laserlight option is replaced by new adaptive LED units with matrix high beam functionality.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=The new BMW 3 Series Sedan and the new BMW 3 Series Touring. |url=https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0388273EN/the-new-bmw-3-series-sedan-and-the-new-bmw-3-series-touring?language=en |access-date=2022-05-18 |website=www.press.bmwgroup.com |language=en}}</ref> The grille maintains its overall proportions while the bumper gets new designs for both the base version and the M Sport package. Both feature new side air curtains, while the latter has a larger central intake (although part of it serves for design purposes only) and more aggressive styling. Tail lights carry the same design as the 2019 model, but are complemented by newly designed bumpers. The base version features body coloured graphics, while the M Sport has a large, gloss-black element that incorporates a faux diffuser and two vertically arranged reflectors.

The interior gets a significant update, with the dashboard being shaped by a new dual curved display that comes as standard and features iDrive with BMW Operating System 8.<ref name=":0" /> With the 2025 model year, iDrive uses BMW Operating System 8.5.

The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission is also fitted as standard, replacing the 6-speed manual entirely, and a new gear selector lever is also present.<ref name=":0" />
